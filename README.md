# React + Vite – Book Finder 📚

This is a simple React application that lets you search for books using the **Open Library API**.  
Type in a book title, hit search, and get a neat grid of results with book covers, authors, and publication years.  
Clicking on a book takes you straight to its Open Library page for more details.
